  <h1>My Hobbies</h1> 
  <h2>Basically things that bring back life in me</h2>
  <ol>
    <h3><li>
        Learning 
    </li></h3>
        <p>I can't say I enjoy learning one specific thing because my interests shift from moment to moment. <br>
            But one thing's for sure: I love learningexploring both what's within me and what surrounds me.</p>
    <h3><li>
        People watching
    </li></h3>
        <p>Well... Not everybody is the same isn't it? 
            That's exactly why there's a need to appreciate diversity.<br>
            I love admiring people.
            If possible, I love hearing their tales, which soothe both me and them.
        </p>
    <h3><li>
        Watching 
    </li></h3>
        <p>
            I’ve always believed that watching positive content—anything that reconnects us with our humanity in some way has a deep impact on our subconscious.<br>
             It somehow helps us attract the right people into our lives and makes us feel loved and like we truly belong.
