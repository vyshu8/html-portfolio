  <h1>My Hobbies</h1> 
  <h2>Basically things that bring back life in me</h2>
  <ol>
    <h3><li>
        Learning 
    </li></h3>
        <p>I can't say i like learning a specifc thing cause by interest keeps changing every moment,
            but one things for sure i love learning ie exploring thing in me and outside me.</p>
    <h3><li>
        People watching
    </li></h3>
        <p>Well... Not everybody is the same isn't it? 
            That's exactly why thers's a need to appreciate diversity.
            I love admiring people.
            If possible,I love hearing their tales which soothes both me and them.
        </p>
    <h3><li>
        Watching 
    </li></h3>
        <p>
            I always believe watching positive content in the sense that the content which brings back our humanity in some or the other form has positive impact on our subconcious.
            It somehow makes us attract the right people into our lives and makes us feel loved and belonged.
